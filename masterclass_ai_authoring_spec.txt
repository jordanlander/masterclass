MASTERCLASS AUTHORING SPEC (v1)
For use with the one-file Masterclass index.html (Markdown or JSON import)

GOAL
Produce research → slide content that the Masterclass app can ingest with zero cleanup.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
A) PREFERRED OUTPUT: MARKDOWN FORMAT
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Rules (strict):
1) Use only headings and hyphen bullets. Avoid code blocks. Images and tables are allowed via special bullets.
2) Headings allowed: H1 (#), H2 (##), H3 (###). Nothing deeper.
3) After the H1 title, the very next line may be a one-line subtitle (plain text).
4) “Table of Contents” must be an H2 exactly:  ## Table of Contents
   Immediately follow it with a simple list of sections using hyphen bullets.
5) Content sections must be H2. Individual slides within a section must be H3.
   Bullets under each H3 become the slide’s body.
6) Keep each bullet ≤ 100 characters. Plain text only.
7) Do not include any prose paragraphs under H3 slides—only bullet lines starting with “- ”.
8) Use blank lines between logical blocks. Avoid bold/italic/links – plain text is safest.
9) To include a YouTube video slide, use an H3 heading with a single bullet containing the full YouTube URL.
10) VIDEO: Under any ### slide, add a bullet: VIDEO: https://...
11) NOTE: Under any ### slide, add one or more NOTE: ... lines (speaker notes; not shown on slide).
12) LINK: Under any ### slide, add LINK: Label | https://...
13) IMG (optional): IMG: https://... | optional caption (shows right-side image).
14) TABLE (optional): Start a bullet with TABLE: then provide Markdown table rows on subsequent lines. First row is headers.
15) HIGHLIGHT (optional): HIGHLIGHT: Title | text (adds a callout card for key ideas, e.g., "Research shows | statistic" or "Best Practice | tip").
16) Bullets may include emojis for emphasis.
17) Continue the pattern for as many slides as needed; no slide limit.

Example (you can copy this shape):

# Best Practices for Paraprofessionals in Pre-K–12 Classrooms

C) VALIDATION CHECKLIST BEFORE YOU HAND IT OFF
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
• If Markdown: starts with one H1; has “## Table of Contents” with hyphen bullets; sections are H2; slides are H3 with hyphen bullets. Tables must follow a TABLE: bullet with pipe rows.
• If JSON: parses cleanly; uses only allowed template ids; all arrays use double quotes; no trailing commas.
• Keep bullets short, plain text; emojis allowed.
• No student-identifying info; keep language objective.

OUTPUT CONTRACT FOR THE AI
• Return ONLY the Markdown (Option A) or ONLY the JSON (Option B).
• Do not include explanations, backticks, or commentary. Just the content.
